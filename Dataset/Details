Data set is taken from kaggle compatetion.

https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stacksample

Descreption of Data Set:
Dataset with the text of 10% of questions and answers from the Stack Overflow programming Q&A website.

This is organized as three tables:

Questions contains the title, body, creation date, closed date (if applicable), score, and owner ID for all non-deleted Stack Overflow questions whose Id is a multiple of 10.
Answers contains the body, creation date, score, and owner ID for each of the answers to these questions. The ParentId column links back to the Questions table.
Tags contains the tags on each of these questions
Datasets of all R questions and all Python questions are also available on Kaggle, but this dataset is especially useful for analyses that span many languages.

Example projects include:

Identifying tags from question text
Predicting whether questions will be upvoted, downvoted, or closed based on their text
Predicting how long questions will take to answer


But here in this project I am using only Questions DataSet.
